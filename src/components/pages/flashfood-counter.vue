      <template slot="description">My task was to create a count-up to display the amount of food waste diverted from landfills by Flashfood users, in real-time. This project involved pulling statistics from the Flashfood database to constantly update the counter, creating an API endpoint to reference when embedding the feature, and designing animating the count-up to increase interactivity.</template>

            <p>A record of order bag weights is stored in the Flashfood database, which updates every 30 minutes. This equates to the total amount of food waste diverted from landfills by the app's users.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>To create an animated counter while displaying accurate statistics, I subtracted a value from the total weight diverted, and increased this value by smaller increments over a given time, until the value displayed was the total weight diverted.
            Unique user experience
            By subtracting a random value between 700 and 1000 from the total weight diverted, I ensured that a unique start number is displayed everytime the page is loaded
            To display the data in a more interesting way, for every increase interval (1.2s), I added a random value between 10 and 20 until the start value matched the total weight diverted
            Digestible change
            To display the data in a way that was easy to understand, the values shown were rounded to two decimal places
            Noticeable and digestible animations
            To ensure the counter displayed the data in a way that resonated with the user, I created a 1s delay before the start of the animation, and incremented the values every 120s. These values were chosen based on the average amount of time spent on the website page and common user movement.

            <p>To access the statistics required from Flashfood's database from the main website, an additional endpoint in Flashfoodâ€™s API was required. This was created using Node.JS. An unexpected error that I came across while completing this task was a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error. This is because the response request was missing an Access-Control-Allow-Origin header and as a result the Flashfood database couldn't be accessed by the main website. The following code was used to overcome this issue:</p>
