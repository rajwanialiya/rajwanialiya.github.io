          <h2>Project Goals</h2>
          <p>The redesign of Flashfood's main website was carried out to meet the following objectives.</p>
          <div class="columns">
              <div>
                  <h4>Improve Brand Alignment</h4>
                  <p>As Flashfood grew to reach a wider audience, its brand evolved. One of the main objectives we aimed to achieve through this project was to ensure that the company’s main website was congruent with other aspects of marketing to ensure a strong, consistent and sustainable brand. Throughout the updated website, Flashfood’s informal yet trust-worthy and reliable brand is emphasized with a consistent copy tone and common visual elements. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Increase Website Conversion Rate</h4>
                  <p>In this case, website conversions can occur in three forms; app downloads, location request submissions, and news subscriptions and notifications. To optimize these conversion rates, call-to-action buttons, statistics to perpetuate the need for change, and a real-time counter to display the food waste diverted through Flashfood’s services were included throughout the site. </p>
              </div>
          </div>
          <div class="columns">
              <div>
                  <h4>Increase Awareness</h4>
                  <p>Among other objectives, Flashfood.com serves an informational purpose;  educate users about the solution being offered. The updated website was designed to clearly explain the solution by combing eye-catching visual elements with concise copy. </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                  <h4>Build a Scaling Solution</h4>
                  <p>As Flashfood grows further, aspects of the brand will continue to evolve. For this reason, it was necessary to build a scalable solution to ensure minor changes can be made quickly and easily. To do this, layouts that can be used consistently were created, and recurring elements were pre-formatted. </p>

              <p>After reviewing the goals and project limitations, a list of requirements to be met by the redesign, was drafted. </p>
              <ul class="requirements"> 
                  <li>Must be responsive and accessible on multiple devices spanning from desktop to mobile</li>
                  <li>Must be available in both French and English</li>
                  <li>Must encourage visitors to input their contact information (email address) into one of the available fields to optimize conversion rates</li>
                  <li>Information must be presented in a clear and concise manner to retain the visitor’s attention, as the existing solution is dense and can be overwhelming</li>
                  <li>The overall web experience should reflect the company’s culture and commitment to positive global change</li>
                  <li>Must reduce friction points and provide multiple entry points to all webpages to encourage the user’s journey</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          <!-- Section 3 -->
          <h2 style="padding-top: 12px">Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>In order to gain a better sense of what a website that met the above requirements looked like, I analyzed and compared aspects of existing websites that aimed to meet similar objectives. This included websites that fulfilled the purposes of informing users of a product or service being offered and converting web visitors, and websites of growing companies. The following are some of the successful web elements from which inspiration was drawn. </p>
          <section>
              <div class="module"  id="column">
                  <div class="images">
                    <!-- <div class="image1"><img src="../assets/hero.png"></div>
                    <div class="image2"><img src="../assets/hero4.png"></div> -->
                  </div>
                  <p> Three similar aspects among the above designs that were incorporated into the redesign are the call-to-action buttons (CTAs) in both the navbar and header, the full-screen size of the hero image and the position of the header text.</p> 
              </div>
              <div class="module" id="row">
                  <p class="paragraphLeft"> Uber directs its user segments to the appropriate sections of their website at the very beginning of the user’s journey. This is done with clear and concise copy, large header text and bright CTAs. When creating wireframes for the redesign, a similar layout was considered to target the two groups of Flashfood users; Shoppers and Vendors. </p> 
                  <!-- <div class="image2"><img src="../assets/User Segmentation.png"></div> -->

          <h2>Unexpected Challenge</h2>
          <!-- <img style="width: 100%" src="../assets/ContactForm.png"> -->
          <p>A challenge I encountered while working on the contact form was the limit on submissions allowed by the platform being used to build and host the main website. The platform allowed for 5,000 form submissions before requiring a plan upgrade, and as a result didn’t offer a long-term or scalable solution to increased website conversion rates. </p>
          <p>To overcome this challenge I intercepted the form submissions and validated the form data before creating an HTTP request via AJAX and returning a success or error message. The form data was then sent to the company’s customer service platform as a pending ticket, where the customer service team could easily respond to inquiries. 
          </p>
          <h2>Result</h2>
          <p>The updated design has been implemented and deployed, and is available at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.flashfood.com/" style="color: #248f41;">www.flashfood.com</a>. A list of additional features that could further improve users' experiences was drafted as the project's deadline approached and are still being implemented. Overall, through the website redesign all the initial objectives and requirements were met.</p>
          <p><b>Improve Brand Alignment</b>: To deem this goal achieved, I consulted the marketing and product design teams for feedback throughout the course of the project, and made the necessary changes.</p>
          <p><b>Increase Website Conversion Rates</b>: Email and newsletter subscription rates increased after the updated website's launch. This means that website conversion rates successfully increased with the redesign of the site.</p>
          <p><b>Increase Awareness</b>: The app's necessary information was presented in a clear and concise manner - all key information is presented in blurbs of less than three sentences</p>
          <p><b>Build a Scaling Solution</b>: Closer to project's completion, Flashfood's services became available in over 100 additional grocery stores. I was able to simply upload a CSV file to add the necessary details to the Locations page. Additionally, as key features of the app were updated, changes were easily made to the appropriate website pages by members of the marketing team to reflect these modifications.</p>
